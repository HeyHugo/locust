API changes
-----------

* WebLocust class has been deprecated and is now called just Locust. The class that was previously 
  called Locust is now called LocustBase.
* The *catch_http_error* argument to HttpClient.get() and HttpClient.post() has been renamed to 
  *allow_http_error*.

Improvements and bug fixes
--------------------------

* Locust now uses python's logging module for all logging
* Added the ability to change the number of spawned users when a test is running, without having
  to restart the test.
* Experimental support for automatically ramping up and down the number of locust to find a maximum
  number of concurrent users (based on some parameters like response times and acceptable failure
  rate).
* Added support for failing requests based on the response data, even if the HTTP response was OK.
* Improved master node performance in order to not get bottlenecked when using enough slaves (>100)
* Minor improvements in web interface.
* Fixed missing template dir in MANIFEST file causing locust installed with "setup.py install" not to work.
